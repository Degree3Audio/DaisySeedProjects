# Ordering Hardware
I'm not really in the business of selling kits or finished pedals, however, sometimes I do end up with extra PCBs since the minimum order from JLCPCB is 5 that I'm willing to sell to folks at cost.  If you are interested, please message me through GitHub or you can find me on the Electro-Smith [Forums](https://forum.electro-smith.com/t/my-daisy-guitar-pedal-designs-on-github/3641) & [Discord](https://discord.gg/ByHBnMtQTR) as Kshep and can message me there.

## Option 1 - PCB Only
Price: $35 (USD) + Shipping & Handling

About as bare bones as you can get. It's just the PCB with all the SMD components soldered on.  You will still need to source the additional parts, solder the additional parts to the PCB, get an Enclosure, get Knobs and other hardware for the Enclosure, get a Daisy Seed, and Assemble everything yourself.

You'll basically be starting at [Step 5: Build the Hardware](README.md#5-order-the-additional-parts-jlcpcb-doesnt-assemble)

## Option 2 - PCB + the Additional Parts to Complete the PCB
Price: $75 (USD) + Shipping & Handling

Sometimes I have the extra parts necessary to complete the PCB lying around.  This option is a step up from Option 1. At least you won't have to order all the additional parts from everywhere! You will still need to solder the additional parts to the PCB, get an Enclosure, get Knobs and other hardware for the Enclosure, get a Daisy Seed, and Assemble everything yourself.

You'll basically be starting at [Step 6: Finish the PCB](README.md#6-finish-the-pcb-solder-everything)
