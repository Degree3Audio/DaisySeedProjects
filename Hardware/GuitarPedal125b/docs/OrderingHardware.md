# Ordering Hardware
I'm not really in the business of selling kits or finished pedals, however, sometimes I do end up with extra PCBs since the minimum order from JLCPCB is 5 that I'm willing to sell to folks at cost.  If you are interested, please message me through GitHub or you can find me on the Electro-Smith [Forums](https://forum.electro-smith.com/t/my-daisy-guitar-pedal-designs-on-github/3641) & [Discord](https://discord.gg/ByHBnMtQTR) as Kshep and can message me there.

#Ordering Options:

## 1) PCB Only
Price: $35 (USD) + Shipping & Handling

About as bare bones as you can get. It's just the PCB with all the SMD components soldered on.  You'll need to source the additional parts, solder them on, get an enclosure and knobs, and assemble everything your self. You'll basically be starting at [Step 5: Build the Hardware](README.md#5-order-the-additional-parts-jlcpcb-doesnt-assemble)
