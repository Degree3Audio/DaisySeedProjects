# Ordering Hardware
I'm not really in the business of selling kits or finished pedals, however, sometimes I do end up with extra PCBs since the minimum order from JLCPCB is 5 that I'm willing to sell to folks at cost.  If you are interested, please message me through GitHub or you can find me on the Electro-Smith [Forums](https://forum.electro-smith.com/t/my-daisy-guitar-pedal-designs-on-github/3641) & [Discord](https://discord.gg/ByHBnMtQTR) as Kshep and can message me there.

## Option 1 - PCB Only
Price: $35 (USD) + Shipping & Handling

About as bare bones as you can get. 

This option is just the PCB with all the SMD components soldered on.  You will still need to source the additional parts, solder the additional parts to the PCB, get an Enclosure, get Knobs and other hardware for the Enclosure, get a Daisy Seed, and Assemble everything yourself.

You'll basically be starting at [Step 5: Build the Hardware](README.md#5-order-the-additional-parts-jlcpcb-doesnt-assemble)

## Option 2 - PCB + the Additional Parts to Complete the PCB
Price: $75 (USD) + Shipping & Handling

Sometimes I have the extra parts necessary to complete the PCB lying around.

This option is a step up from Option 1. At least you won't have to order all the additional parts from everywhere! You will still need to solder the additional parts to the PCB, get an Enclosure, get Knobs and other hardware for the Enclosure, get a Daisy Seed, and Assemble everything yourself.

You'll basically be starting at [Step 6: Finish the PCB](README.md#6-finish-the-pcb-solder-everything)

## Option 3 - Complete PCB
Price: $100 (USD) + Shipping & Handling

Not feeling like you want to solder anything? I hear ya, me either.

This option gets you a fully assembled PCB, I'll even test it (briefly) to make sure it works. You will still need to get an Enclosure, get Knobs and other hardware for the Enclosure, get a Daisy Seed, and Assemble everything yourself.

You'll basically be starting at [Step 7: Order the Enclosure and External Hardware](README.md#7-order-the-enclosure-and-external-hardware)

## Option 4 - Complete PCB + Enclosure & Knobs (without Daisy Seed)
Price: $150 (USD) + Shipping & Handling

I usally don't have extra Enclosures and Knobs around, so this might not be an option. Plus picking a custom color and knobs for your pedal is half the fun! [Step 7: Order the Enclosure and External Hardware](README.md#7-order-the-enclosure-and-external-hardware) is so freaking easy, I highly don't recommend this option.

This option is the full kit. Everything you need to finish the Pedal, except the Daisy Seed. You will still need Assemble everything yourself.

You'll basically be starting at [Step 8: Flash the Software to the Daisy Seed](README.md#8-flash-the-software-to-the-daisy-seed-on-the-hardware)

## Option 5 - Complete Pedal (with or without Daisy Seed)
Price: Market Price (Ask Me)

Honestly, I don't love this option, but I might be willing to go the extra mile, depending if I'm really feeling generous with my time. Like I said at the beginning, I'm not really interested in getting into the business of selling pedals or kits.

You'll basically get a finished product ready for you to create your own cool effects.
