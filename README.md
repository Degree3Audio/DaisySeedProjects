# Daisy Seed Projects
This is a demo of a pedal board I put together using 3 of my custom Daisy Seed based guitar pedals. I designed and built the hardware and programmed the software. Everything shown here is open source and all the code, pcb files, and basic instructions on how to build the pedals, can be found on these pages.

## Software Projects:
### 1. [Guitar Multi-Effect Pedal](Software/GuitarPedal/README.md)
The software that can run on any of the custom Guitar Pedal hardware projects listed below.  This software is a flexible platform that abstracts the underlying Guitar Pedal hardware and allows a collection of Effects Modules to run on any of those hardware platforms.

## Hardware Projects:
### 1. [Guitar Effect Pedal in 1590b Enclosure](Hardware/GuitarPedal1590b/README.md) (Through-hole parts)
A robust and tiny platform for making DSP based guitar FX pedals. Stereo Audio, Midi in/out, 4 Knobs, 2 LEDs, 1 or 2 Foot Switches, all based on the Daisy Seed microcontroller.

### 2. Guitar Effect Pedal in 1590b Enclosure (SMD Parts) - COMING SOON!
### 3. [Guitar Effect Pedal in 125b Enclosure](Hardware/GuitarPedal125b/README.md) (SMD Parts)
A feature rich and flexible platform for making DSP based guitar FX pedals. Stereo Audio, Midi in/out, OLED Display, Rotary Encoder for Menu Navigation, 6 Knobs, 2 LEDs, 2 Foot Switches, Relay based "True Bypass" switching, all based on the Daisy Seed microcontroller.
