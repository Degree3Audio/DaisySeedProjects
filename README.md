# Daisy Seed Projects
This is a demo of a pedal board I put together using 3 of my custom Daisy Seed based guitar pedals. I designed and built the hardware and programmed the software. Everything shown here is open source and all the code, pcb files, and basic instructions on how to build the pedals, can be found on these pages.

## Software Projects:
### 1. [Guitar Multi-Effect Pedal](Software/GuitarPedal/README.md)
The software that can run on any of the custom Guitar Pedal hardware projects listed below as well at the PedalPCB Terrarium hardware.  This software is a flexible platform that abstracts the underlying Guitar Pedal hardware and allows a collection of Effects Modules to run on any of those hardware platforms.

## Hardware Projects:

I provide everything you need to build any of pedals you see below along with pretty detailed documentation.  However, recently I started to get a lot of requests to buy kits or finished pedals based on my designs. This is not something I typically do, but sometimes I do have extra PCBs, parts, and enclosures lying around and I'm willing to pass them along to you, basically at cost. I've included some ordering details along with each design below.

### 1. [Guitar Effect Pedal in 125b Enclosure](Hardware/GuitarPedal125b/README.md) (SMD Parts)
A feature rich and flexible platform for making DSP based guitar FX pedals. Stereo Audio, Midi in/out, OLED Display, Rotary Encoder for Menu Navigation, 6 Knobs, 2 LEDs, 2 Foot Switches, Relay based "True Bypass" switching, all based on the Daisy Seed microcontroller.

### 2. [Guitar Effect Pedal in 1590b Enclosure](Hardware/GuitarPedal1590b-SMD/README.md) (SMD Parts)

A robust and tiny platform for making DSP based guitar FX pedals. Stereo Audio, Midi in/out, 4 Knobs, 2 LEDs, 1 or 2 Foot Switches, Relay based "True Bypass" switching, all based on the Daisy Seed microcontroller. Using SMD parts for easy manufacturing by a fab such as JLCPCB.

### 3. [Guitar Effect Pedal in 1590b Enclosure](Hardware/GuitarPedal1590b/README.md) (Through-hole parts)

Same form factor and features as the SMD version of the 1590b pedal, minus the Relay based "True Bypass" switching. Using all Through-Hole parts for easy assembly at home with limited soldering skills.
