# Guitar Pedal 125b
A project to create a digital effect pedal based on the Electro-Smith Daisy Seed that fits into a standard 125B sized Guitar Pedal enclosure. This project is still work in progress and is an evolution of my [1590B sized Pedal](https://github.com/bkshepherd/DaisySeedProjects/tree/main/GuitarPedal1590b). 

This one uses a slightly larger enclosure, incorporates primarily SMD parts, includes a display. two digital rotary encoders with push buttons, 3 analog potentiometers, relayed based audio bypass switching, stereo in / out audio trs jacks, and midi in / out mini-trs jacks, so it's quite flexible and can be programmed to do a lot.

This project includes a KiCad project with the necessary schematics and PCB layout files to create everything you need to build the hardware and code the provides a hardware attraction layer as well as sample code with a custom Tremolo effect that uses the hardware.
