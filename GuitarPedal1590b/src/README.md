Sample Code that uses the custom guitar_pedal_1590b hardware. 

Currently sample code implements a chorus effect on the Audio input and routes it to the Audio Output on the hardware.  The various hardware knobs and switches are also mapped to parameters on the effect. There is also some limited Midi In/Out and OLED display screen test code.
